Title: kirby

----

Intro: Returns the root of the Kirby core folder

----

Custom:

If you want to overwrite the root you can do this in your `index.php` by passing a custom roots setup to the Kirby constructor.

```php "/index.php"
<?php

// Use autoloader instead of bootstrap (see comment in bootstrap "users need to load the autoloader themselves")

include '/absolute/path/to/custom/root/vendor/autoload.php';

$kirby = new Kirby([
    'roots' => [
        'kirby' => '/absolute/path/to/custom/root',
    ],
]);

echo $kirby->render();

```
